# Countdown Timer Website

This is a simple countdown timer website that displays the time remaining until a specified date. The website is under maintenance and shows a countdown to its launch date.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files and directories:
├── index.html # The main HTML file

├── style.css # The CSS file for styling the webpage
├── images # Directory containing image assets

│ ├── logo.png

│ ├── rocket.png

│ └── triangle.png

└── README.md # This README file


## HTML Structure

The `index.html` file contains the structure of the webpage, including the countdown timer and maintenance message. It uses a combination of divs, images, and other HTML elements to create the layout.

## CSS Styling

The `style.css` file contains the styles for the webpage, including the background, font colors, layout, and positioning of elements.

## JavaScript Functionality

The countdown timer functionality is implemented using JavaScript embedded within the `index.html` file. The script calculates the time remaining until the specified date and updates the countdown display every second.

### Key JavaScript Functionality:

- **Countdown Calculation:** Calculates the time remaining until the specified launch date.
- **Dynamic Update:** Updates the days, hours, minutes, and seconds every second.
- **Countdown Completion:** Stops the countdown when the target date is reached and sets the time to "00".

## Images

The `images` directory contains the image assets used in the webpage:
- `logo.png`: The logo displayed at the top of the page.
- `rocket.png`: The rocket image displayed at the bottom of the page.
- `triangle.png`: The triangle icon used in the "Learn More" button.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the countdown timer webpage.
2. The webpage will display the time remaining until the specified launch date.
